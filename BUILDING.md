# Building 240-MP

If you are interested in building your own version of 240-MP and adding things to it then this page should hopefully cover what you would need to get an environment set up.  I've included details for macOS on ARM (where I primarily build) and Raspberry Pi OS.  And if you create a feature you would like to contribute back to this repo please open a PR, I'd be glad to talk through it.

## macOS (ARM)

### Prerequisites (one-time)

**Set up Build tools:**

```bash
brew install cmake
```

**Install Qt 6.*:**

- Download from [qt.io/download](https://qt.io/download) or `brew install qt@6`.
- Install to `~/Qt/`

**Install mpv (required for playback):**

```bash
brew install mpv
```

Note: 240-MP uses mpv as an external subprocess for video playback. It does not link against libmpv at build time, so mpv only needs to be on your `PATH` when running the app.

**Install yt-dlp (optional, required only for the YouTube module):**

```bash
brew install yt-dlp
```

mpv's ytdl hook uses `yt-dlp` to resolve YouTube URLs at playback time. The YouTube module also expects at least one of two files in the data directory (`#` comments allowed in both; each file only gates its own menu entries): `youtube_subscriptions.txt` (one channel ID per line — enables Subscriptions/Channels; see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)) and/or `youtube_playlists.txt` (one playlist URL or ID per line, optional `My Name | <url>` display-name prefix — enables Playlists; contents are fetched by running `yt-dlp` directly).

**Install SDL2 (required, gamepad input):**

```bash
brew install sdl2
```

SDL2 is a build-time dependency — `InputManager` links against it for USB game controller support (see [Gamepad input](#gamepad-input-inputcfg)).

### Get the source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anthonycaccese/240-mp.git
cd 240-mp
```

### Build

**First time, and after any CMakeLists.txt changes:**

```bash
cmake -B build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=~/Qt/6.11.0/macos . && cmake --build build
```

**For incremental builds:**

```bash
cmake --build build
```

### Run

You can either double-click `build/240mp.app` in Finder, or run from the terminal:

```bash
APP_ROOT=$(pwd) ./build/240mp.app/Contents/MacOS/240mp
```

### Configuration

On macOS all user configuration is stored at:

```
~/Library/Application Support/240-MP/
  config.json       ← app and module settings
  plex_auth.json    ← plex auth
  input.cfg         ← optional gamepad mapping overrides (see Gamepad input below)
```

This directory is created automatically on first run. It is separate from the app itself, so deleting or rebuilding the app will not wipe your settings.

## Raspberry Pi OS (arm64)

### Prerequisites (one-time)

Run on the Pi with RPi OS Trixie (Debian 13):

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y \
  build-essential cmake \
  qt6-base-dev qt6-declarative-dev \
  qml6-module-qtquick qml6-module-qtquick-controls \
  qml6-module-qtquick-window \
  libqt6svg6 qt6-svg-dev qt6-svg-plugins qt6-wayland \
  libdrm-dev libxkbcommon-dev libssl-dev \
  libsdl2-dev \
  mpv
```

`mpv` is the playback engine — 240-MP launches it as a subprocess. No libmpv build dependency is required.

For the YouTube module, additionally install `yt-dlp` (`sudo apt-get install -y yt-dlp`) — mpv's ytdl hook uses it to resolve YouTube URLs at playback time.

### Get the source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anthonycaccese/240-mp.git
cd 240-mp
```

### Build

**First time, and after any CMakeLists.txt changes:**

```bash
cmake -B build
```

**For incremental builds:**

```bash
cmake --build build
```

No `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` needed — Qt 6 from apt is found automatically.

### Run

**With a desktop** (RPi OS Full with a display server):

```bash
APP_ROOT=$(pwd) ./build/240mp
```

**Without a Desktop** (RPi OS Lite with no display server):

```bash
APP_ROOT=$(pwd) QT_QPA_PLATFORM=eglfs ./build/240mp
```

`eglfs` uses the KMS/DRM framebuffer directly without X11 or Wayland.

### Configuration

On Raspberry Pi OS all user configuration is stored at:

```
~/.local/share/240-MP/
  config.json      ← app and module settings
  plex_auth.json   ← plex auth
  input.cfg        ← optional gamepad mapping overrides (see Gamepad input below)
```

This directory is created automatically on first run. It is separate from the app itself, so deleting or rebuilding the app will not wipe your settings.

## Gamepad input (input.cfg)

USB game controllers should work out of the box as SDL's built-in controller database normalizes most pads (Xbox, PlayStation, 8BitDo, NES-style clones etc...) to a standard layout. 240-MP maps that stanard layout to its navigation actions:

| Controller input | Action |
|---|---|
| D-pad / left stick | navigate (up / down / left / right) |
| A | select |
| B/Select | back |
| Start | play / pause |
| LB / RB shoulder buttons | left / right (seek during playback) |

Controllers can be hotplugged at any time and during playback the same buttons drive mpv (seek, pause, quit) exactly like their keyboard equivalents.

**Overriding the mapping**

- Create an `input.cfg` file in the configuration directory. 
- Add one binding per line, `<input> <action>`; 
- Use `#` to start a comment, data is case-insensitive and you only need to include the things you want to change (anything not defined will fall back to defaults) 
- The file is also live-reloaded while the app runs, so you can tune bindings without restarting.

Inputs use SDL controller names — short (`a`, `b`, `x`, `y`, `back`, `start`, `leftshoulder`, `rightshoulder`, `dpup`, `dpdown`, `dpleft`, `dpright`, ...) or the long `SDL_CONTROLLER_BUTTON_*` forms. Analog axes take a `+`/`-` direction suffix (`lefty-`, `triggerright+`). Actions: `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`, `select`, `back`, `play_pause`, and `none` to unbind a default.

**Button names are positional**, following an Xbox reference layout: `a` means the *south* face button, `b` east, `x` west, `y` north, no matter what's "printed" on the buttons on your pad. Because of that you can also write the positions directly: `south`, `east`, `west`, `north`. So `south select` makes the bottom face button select on an Xbox pad, an 8BitDo, and a PlayStation pad alike.

**Footer labels** will attempt to adapt automatically and the on-screen hints show what's printed on the controller you touched last (Nintendo-type pads show B at south, PlayStation pads show X/O/SQ/TR). If your controller reports the wrong type (which is common for pads with Nintendo-style labels running in X-input mode) you can define the label you see with a `label` line in the input.cfg

```
# input.cfg — example overrides
south                    select       # positions: south/east/west/north
SDL_CONTROLLER_BUTTON_A  select       # long names work
b                        back         # so do SDL short names ("b" = east)
x                        play_pause
rightshoulder            none         # unbind a default
lefty-                   up           # axes take a +/- suffix
triggerright+            play_pause
label south B                         # force the footer label to display "B" for the south button
label east  A                         # force the footer label to display "B" for the east button
```

Any bad lines are skipped with a warning in the log (line number included)

**Exotic controllers** — if SDL doesn't recognize your pad at all, drop a community [gamecontrollerdb.txt](https://github.com/mdqinc/SDL_GameControllerDB) into the configuration directory; it will be loaded at startup before controllers are opened.

## Video decode tuning (mpv_video_args)

240-MP detects your device at startup and attempts to launch with the most efficient video-output and hardware-decode flags for it. Currently the Pi 3 uses a low-CPU overlay path, the Pi 4 a hardware-decode + copy path, the Pi 5 the V3D Vulkan path, and macOS VideoToolbox. The exact flags and the reasoning per board are in [ARCHITECTURE.md → Per-device video decode profiles](ARCHITECTURE.md#per-device-video-decode-profiles).

**Overriding the decode flags**

If you find the need to tune for your hardware, you can add an `mpv_video_args` string under `"app"` in `config.json`.  It accepts a a space-separated list of mpv flags to replace the auto-detected `--vo` / `--hwdec` params that 240-MP sets.

```json
{
  "app": {
    "mpv_video_args": "--vo=drm --hwdec=v4l2m2m-copy"
  }
}
```

This config is read at each playback event, so a change applies on the next playback (no rebuild or restart needed). Only set video-output/decode flags here though; the app owns the rest (the IPC control channel, OSC, input) and for other mpv preferences (things like deinterlace, cache, subtitle styling...) please just create a standard `~/.config/mpv/mpv.conf`. MPV will read that automatically every launch. Please check out [ARCHITECTURE.md → How mpv flags are layered](ARCHITECTURE.md#how-mpv-flags-are-layered-the-precedence-cascade) if you are interested in the background on this approach.

**Enabling crop on a Pi 3** — the Pi 3 default uses a zero-copy overlay path for performance, and a hardware overlay plane can't zoom/crop, so the OSC crop button blanks the video there. To allow crop to work on the Pi3 you can override to the copy path (so frames go through the scaler, where crop works):

```json
"mpv_video_args": "--vo=drm --hwdec=v4l2m2m-copy"
```

The trade-off with this approach: the copy path didn't look like it could reliabilty play back 1080p on the Pi 3 in my testing. I found it can easily peg the CPU and cause stuttering. So enabling crop on a Pi 3 means keeping your source content to **720p and below**. Ultimately its your call: smooth 1080p without crop (keep the default), or enable crop with a 720p ceiling using --hwdec=v4l2m2m-copy.

## Debugging & logs

240-MP logs to **stdout/stderr** via Qt's `qDebug` / `qWarning` (used throughout `AppCore`, `MpvController`, and the module backends). The trick is knowing where that output goes depending on how you launched the app.

### Option 1: Running from source

Just run the binary in a terminal and the logs will print right there:

```bash
# macOS
APP_ROOT=$(pwd) ./build/240mp.app/Contents/MacOS/240mp

# Raspberry Pi
APP_ROOT=$(pwd) ./build/240mp                         # with a desktop
APP_ROOT=$(pwd) QT_QPA_PLATFORM=eglfs ./build/240mp   # headless / Lite
```

### Option 2: Raspberry Pi installed via `install.sh`

How you read logs depends on whether you installed the autostart service:

- **Run it by hand** — type `240mp` over SSH and logs print to that terminal. Use this while debugging. (Note: the launcher does **not** power off on exit, unlike the service.)
- **Via the systemd service** — the service sends output to the journal, so:
    ```bash
    journalctl -u 240mp -b        # logs from this boot
    journalctl -u 240mp -f        # follow live
    ```
    Heads-up: the autostart service runs `ExecStopPost=240mp-stop`, which **powers the Pi off when you quit** (exit 0) — the console disappears with it. To debug without powering off, either pick **Exit to Terminal** in the Quit dialog (drops to a login shell on `tty1` without removing the service — `sudo systemctl start 240mp` or `sudo reboot` to return to the service), or stop the service and run the binary directly:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl stop 240mp
    240mp
    ```

### mpv playback logs

During playback the app hands off to mpv as a subprocess (see [ARCHITECTURE.md → Playback Hand-off](ARCHITECTURE.md#playback-hand-off-mpvcontroller)). `MpvController` writes mpv's own output to a log file in the temp dir alongside its IPC socket (`/tmp/240mp-mpv.sock`) — useful when a video won't play or transcoding misbehaves.

### Qt / QML debugging knobs

These environment variables help when the UI itself is misbehaving:

```bash
QT_LOGGING_RULES="qt.qml.*=true"   # verbose QML engine logging
QML_IMPORT_TRACE=1                 # trace QML import resolution (missing modules/components)
QT_QPA_EGLFS_DEBUG=1               # EGLFS/DRM detail on Raspberry Pi headless
```

Set them inline, e.g. `QML_IMPORT_TRACE=1 APP_ROOT=$(pwd) ./build/240mp`.

## GitHub Actions

### How to trigger a build

Releases are built automatically when you push a version tag:

```bash
git tag v2026.06.04
git push origin v2026.06.04
```

And you can use pre-release tags to test CI without making a public release:

```bash
git tag v1.0.0-rc1
git push origin v1.0.0-rc1
```

Tags containing `-rc`, `-beta`, or `-alpha` are published as GitHub pre-releases.

### What the workflow does

These build jobs run in parallel:

| Job | Runner | Output |
|---|---|---|
| `build-macos-arm64` | `macos-latest` (Apple Silicon) | `240-MP-<tag>-macOS-arm64.dmg` |
| `build-linux-arm64` | `ubuntu-24.04-arm` (native arm64) | `240-MP-<tag>-linux-arm64.tar.gz` |

macOS jobs: installs Qt via the Qt CDN, builds, runs `macdeployqt` to embed Qt frameworks (including `libSDL2.dylib`), ad-hoc codesign, package as `.dmg`. mpv is not bundled — users install it via `brew install mpv`.

Linux arm64 job: installs Qt from apt, builds, package as `.tar.gz`. mpv and SDL2 are not bundled — end users install them via `apt install mpv libsdl2-2.0-0` or by running the `install.sh` that is bundled with each release where they are installed as part of the dependency list.

A final `release` job waits for all three builds, then creates a GitHub Release with all artifacts attached (including `install.sh`).

### Output

**While the workflow is running:**

Go to **Actions** → select the workflow run → each build job has an **Artifacts** section at the bottom where you can download that job's output before the release is published.

**After the workflow completes:**

Go to the repository on GitHub → **Releases** → select the release for the tag you set. All three artifacts are listed under Assets.
